# Python Factorial Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.

## How It Works

The program prompts the user to enter an integer to calculate its factorial. It then checks if the entered number is positive. If it is, the program calculates the factorial of that number and displays the result. Otherwise, it displays a message indicating that the entered value is invalid.

## Limitation

- There is no handling for inputs that are not integers.

## Installation Requirement

- Python 3.x

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a non-negative integer when prompted.
3. The program will calculate and display the factorial of that number.
